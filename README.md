Minesweeper in C, powered by your terminal. Made for the final computing project of CY Tech's Pré-ING1 year.

## How do I play this game ?
First things first, open a terminal on a Linux distribution. Sorry, there was no budget for Windows compatibility. *(There was no budget at all.)*

Next, you'd want to use *git* to clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MineCYper-Team/MineCYper
```
Go into the root of the repository.
```bash
cd MineCYper
```
Make sure you have *make* and *gcc*. Then run :
```bash
make run_release
```
to compile and immediately play MineCYper.

*There are other options present in the Makefile to accomodate your needs.*

## How do I play ?

### The actual game
Use the in-game tutorial, and if it's not enough, you can rely on [this French website](https://www.demineur-ligne.com/rules). Good luck if you don't know French !

### Prompts

*(No budget for mouse support either.)*

- Selecting a menu : enter the integer of the selection you wish to make.
- Selecting a square *(ingame)* : enter the coordinates of the square you wish to use in the A1 format.
- Selecting an action *(ingame)* : enter either R (to reveal a square) or F (to put a flag on it).
